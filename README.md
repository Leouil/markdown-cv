# markdown-cv

This repository hosts my curriculum vitae maintained in plain text (Markdown) and rendered to html and pdf using CSS and GitHub Actions.

This project is a fork of David Whipp's (from elipapa originally) markdown cv repository. Feel free to check the original (https://github.com/elipapa/markdown-cv/blob/master/README.md) for updates.
